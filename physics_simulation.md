# physics simulation

it is important to understand that the fundemental insight of the janus model rests on the fact that simply having a negative mass to represent "anti-material" should allow us to use all the same mathematics as we normally would, but give us better results at scale.

it is important that we conceive our simulation working in steps of time of arbritary uniform length. this allows us to granully change the speed of change in our simulation. 


calculating the influence of gravity on a star is the same for clusters of stars as it is for two objects. basically we use the same math but aggregate the mass and coordinates of all the stars influencing the object of focus. this creates a new mass and a new center of gravity. introducing the "anti-material" or negative material does not change this in the slightest.
