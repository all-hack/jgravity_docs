# First Principles
The goal is to build a system that implements these principles.


#### Gravatational Particle Interaction In The Janus Model
1. 2 types of particles
   * Positive
   * Negative
2. Particles Of The Same Type Attract
   * |Positive| ---> <--- |Positive|
   * |Negative| ---> <--- |Negative|
3. Particles Of Different Types Repel
   * <--- |Positive||Negative| --->

#### Properties of Stars
* Arbritary Masses
  * Positive mass indicates positive material
  * Negative mass indicates negative material
* Current Position x, y, z
* Velocity for x, y, z
* To Calculate New Coordinates
  * Aggregate all forces acting on the star
  * Perform the gravitational equation between the star and the forces acting upon it
* Sphere of Influence Derived From Mass (not in initial versions)
  * This is the distance from the particle in which other particles are influenced

#### Properties of Universe
* Initialized at a drop zone
  * An area in the universe in which stars are spawned initially
