# rendering

rendering the data is going to be more difficult than anticipated.

* issues come across while attempting
  * scaling
    * how do we scale everything appropriately to represent the data at our disposa we are simulating?
      * if each star is a pixel then we're gonna have an *fun* time fitting it on the screen
  * rendering
    * we are going need to build a custom renderer because the pieces of code from the graphics brach, can be adapted but will not work out of the box
