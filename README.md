# jgravity_docs

This repo is contains all documentation for working on the jgravity project.

The [jgravity project](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-1wnpl3HILiNFM4VXhBeVE4UUE)is an attempt to simulate the universe as detailed by the [The	Janus	Cosmological	Model](https://www.savoir-sans-frontieres.com/JPP/telechargeables/English/janus/The%20Janus%20Cosmological%20Model.pdf).

To summerize, the Janus Model conceives two types of matter that have simple relationships between each other. We conceive these two types of matter as Positive Matter and Negative Matter. Positive Matter atracts other Positive Matter, and repels Negative Matter, whereas Negative Matter attracts other Negative Matter and repels Positive Matter. The central intuition of this model is that by using **positive mass** to represent Positive Matter, and **negative mass** to represent Negative Matter we should be able to use basic gravitational mathematical concepts to explain much of the behavior observed in our cosmos.

The core of this project is the [physics simulation]().
