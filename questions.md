# Questions
Questions we have yet to answer

* What kind of structures are we going to hold our data?
* How do we take in input parameters? Files? Add more and more from stdin and user input from command line?
* Collision detection and occupying the same coordinates? (unit collision)
* Inherent velocity?
* When are we initializing threads?
* Do we have particle rotation?
* We will lose accuracy with steps of time
* What libraries are we going to use?
* What norms should we follow as a whole and what kind of coding style will we use?
* What language will we code this in?
* How are we going to designate tasks?
* Final projected destinations?
* Does order of particle processing matter?
* If a group of particles (2 or more) only interact with each other, can we calculate a final trajectory ONCE without recalculating because no outside forces are acting upon them?
* Optimization
* Will we have combinations of particles that occupy the same space?
