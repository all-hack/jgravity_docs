# questions
questions we have yet to answer

* what kind of structures are we going to hold our data?
* how do we take in input parameters? files? Add more and more from stdin and user input from command line?
* collision detection and occupying the same coordinates? (unit collision)
* inherent velocity?
* when are we initializing threads?
* do we have particle rotation?
* we will lose accuracy with steps of time
* what libraries are we going to use?
* what norms should we follow as a whole and what kind of coding style will we use?
* What language will we code this in?
* how are we going to designate tasks?
* final projected destinations?
* does order of particle processing matter?
* if a group of particles (2 or more) only interact with each other, can we calculate a final trajectory ONCE without recalculating because no outside forces are acting upon them?
  * optimization
* will we have combinations of particles that occupy the same space?
